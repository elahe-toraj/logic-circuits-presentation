This project showcases an interactive presentation on Digital Logic Circuits and Counters. It provides an engaging and visually appealing demonstration of how logic gates work and how digital counters are implemented in real-world applications. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project combines dynamic animations with educational content to help users understand the fundamentals of digital electronics.

In this interactive demo, users can explore:

The behavior of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
The operation of digital counters and how they are used in various applications
An animated background simulating stars and logic circuits to enhance the learning experience
The goal of this project is to present complex concepts in an easy-to-understand and visually stimulating way, making learning digital logic fun and interactive.
